# Pizza_Sales_Report
Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze pizza sales data using SQL queries and visualize the findings using Power BI. By conducting a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales, we aim to extract valuable insights that can help improve business strategies, identify popular trends, and optimize sales performance.

What I Learned:
Through this project, I gained a deep understanding of data analysis, SQL querying, and data visualization using Power BI. Specifically, I learned the following:
Data Extraction and Transformation: I learned how to extract data from a relational database using SQL queries. I practiced performing data cleaning, filtering, and transformation to ensure the data is suitable for analysis.

SQL Aggregation and Joins: I honed my skills in using SQL's aggregate functions to calculate metrics such as total sales, average order value, and popular toppings. I also grasped the concept of SQL joins to combine data from multiple tables.

Data Visualization with Power BI: I explored the Power BI tool to create insightful visualizations. I learned to design interactive dashboards, charts, and graphs that present the sales data in a clear and meaningful way.

Identifying Sales Patterns: By analyzing the data, I was able to identify peak sales periods, customer preferences, and top-selling pizza variations. This allowed me to suggest potential strategies to enhance sales during specific times and promote popular menu items.

Customer Segmentation: Through segmentation analysis, I classified customers based on their ordering behavior and preferences. This insight can be used to tailor marketing campaigns and promotions to different customer segments.

Profitability Analysis: I conducted an analysis of the cost of ingredients versus the selling price to determine the profitability of different pizza options. This information can guide decisions related to pricing and menu composition.


Project Components:

SQL Scripts: This folder contains the SQL scripts used to extract, transform, and analyze the pizza sales data. Scripts include data aggregation, filtering, and joining operations.

Data Files: This folder houses the raw data files used in the analysis, including information about orders, customers, pizzas, and ingredients.

Power BI Files: The Power BI files showcase the visualizations and dashboards created for the pizza sales analysis. Users can explore interactive charts, graphs, and insights.

By completing this project, I have demonstrated my ability to combine SQL querying and data visualization techniques to gain valuable insights from real-world data. This experience will undoubtedly contribute to my expertise in data analysis and visualization.
